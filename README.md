This is going to be a wild journey

In file directory create virtual environment (run in terminal)
 `python3 -m venv venv`

Install Flask (run in terminal)
  `pip install Flask`

Install psycopg2 (run in terminal)
  `pip install psycopg2-binary`

Activate virtual environment (run in terminal)
  `. venv/bin/activate`

-- To Run Server --

`export FLASK_APP=PetHotelServer.py` (sets server?)

`python -m flask run` (actually runs server similar to npm start)
